# Concrete CMS add-on: Macareux CSV User Import & Export

This package enables it to export users as CSV files and import users from CSV files.

Concrete Core has a feature to export users, but you can select columns to export with this package.

This package supports Concrete CMS version 9+ only.
You can use the [legacy version](https://github.com/MacareuxDigital/csv_user_import_export) if you're running Concrete CMS version 8.
